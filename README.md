# The Odin Project: CV Application
This project is the first React based project in The Odin Project. The CV application is an exercise in using React to build a simple curriculum vitae form. The app was purposely built with class components to help get used to that pattern. The main goal of this project is to solidify my understanding of state, props, and rendering multiple stateful components in React.
