# The Odin Project: CV Application
This project is the first React based project in The Odin Project. The CV application is an exercise in using React to build a simple curriculum vitae form. ~~The app is purposely built with class components to help get used to that pattern.~~ The app components have been converted to function components. The main goal of this project is to solidify my understanding of state, props, and rendering multiple stateful components in React.
